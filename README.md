# BISO-Playbook
The Business Information Security Officer (BISO) Playbook is a guide for building information security programs that enable the business and development teams. It is intended to be a dynamic and community driven set of best practices that help information security officers build meaningful and trusted relationships with their colleagues to help the business grow securely.

## What is a BISO?
A BISO is responsible for leading the information security control adoption and risk management within a specific business unit. Often times, this individual is an extension of the CISO and a swiss-army knife who is responsible for:

1. Serving as a trusted advisor to business and technology units, ensuring that cyber risk is managed within appetite and that the business can grow responsibly
2. Proactively identifying emerging security challenges and partnering with the business, security, and technology organizations to address
3. Advising the broader information security organization on business requirements and technology strategy; pursue opportunities to reduce friction and improve scalability and sustainability of security controls.
4. Monitoring industry and information security trends and effectively communicating key risks and mitigation strategies to stakeholders.
