# BISO-Playbook
The Business Information Security Officer (BISO) Playbook is a guide for building information security programs that enable the business and development teams. It is intended to be a dynamic and community driven set of best practices that help information security officers build meaningful and trusted relationships with their colleagues to help the business grow securely.

## What is a BISO?
A BISO is responsible for leading the information security control adoption and risk management within a specific business unit. Often times, this individual is an extension of the CISO and a swiss-army knife who is responsible for:

1. Serving as a trusted advisor to business and technology units, ensuring that cyber risk is managed within appetite and that the business can grow responsibly
2. Proactively identifying emerging security challenges and partnering with the business, security, and technology organizations to address
3. Advising the broader information security organization on business requirements and technology strategy; pursue opportunities to reduce friction and improve scalability and sustainability of security controls.
4. Monitoring industry and information security trends and effectively communicating key risks and mitigation strategies to stakeholders.

3. Risk and Control Assessments and Reporting
- Assess inherent risk and the design and effectiveness of information security controls
- Oversee and advise on remediation of cyber security gaps to secure against potential threats and known vulnerabilities
- Regularly report information security risk to key stakeholders

## What are the Key Functions and Key Questions a BISO should have answers to?

1. Vulnerability Risk Management and Remediation Oversight
- What is the vulnerability exposure by business unit and severity?
- How is remediation tracking against service level agreements? 
- Do any mitigating controls need to be put in place to reduce a specific vulnerability risk in the short term?
- Is there a design pattern we can follow to address a particular vulnerability?

2. Risk and Control Assessments 
- What is the likelihood and consequence of a threat?
- Are existing controls operating effectively to mitigate the risk?
- Are controls designed to be scalable and sustainable?
- What control enhancements should be considered to further reduce risk to the business?

3. Information Security Policies and Standards
- What impact will proposed changes to security policies have on the business and technology units?
- What is the strategy to bring impacted stakeholders into compliance?
- Where do key stakeholders need additional security guidance?
- What user exceptions to security requirements are needed?  Are these properly documented, reviewed, approved, and recertified?

4. Incident management
- What are the trigger points for escalating an incident to business and technology units?
- What security consulting support is needed to mitigate the effects of an incident?
- What steps can be taken to prevent a similar incident from taking place again?

5. Vendor security risk management 
- What are the minimum security requirements for vendors?
- Are vendors meeting these minimum requirements?  If not, are plans in place to remediate or has the business risk accepted?
- Do contracts have the appropriate security terms in place?  If not, has the business risk accepted?

6. Security Architecture support / threat modeling
- What characteristics of a system’s design should be modified in order to minimize the security risk for the owners, users, and operators of the system?

7. Key Risk Reporting
- What are the key security risks to the business?
- How should remediation be prioritized?
- What industry and information security trends are emerging that require stakeholder awareness?

8. Security Awareness
- What are the phishing click rates and reporting rates for each business unit and for the high risk user population?
- What opportunities exist to raise employee awareness of social engineering and other security risks (e.g., proper handling of sensitive data, password best practices, etc)?
